# ☄️Comet Messenger
A simple realtime messaging app built with svelte and socket.io

# 💻Client
The client is built with sveltekit and socket.io client, it is currently mainly in one file but I aim the split it into components at a later point.

# 📡 Server
The server is just a nodejs server running socket.io server, it is also in one file which i aim to split up eventually as the server grows.

# 🏃How to run it
You can only run it right now in development mode, this can be done by installing node js and running the following commands:

**In /server**

    # Install
    npm i
    
    # Run
    npm run dev
**In /client**

    # Install
    npm i
    
    # Run
    npm run dev
